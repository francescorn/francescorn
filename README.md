I am Frances Cornwall.

I am a contributor to WebKit's WebInspectorUI and Chromium's DevTools.

I proposed an All Fonts Feature at the WebKit Contributors Meeting 2023.

I graduated from Vassar College with a bachelor's degree in biology.

I decided to pursue software engineering after college because it is more interesting.

I'm a former college tennis player who won the Matthew Vassar award for the best athlete of my gender in my class year.

I'm looking for a role as a software engineer.

My skills include HTML, CSS, Javascript, React, C++, Regex, and Python.

You can reach me at frances_c@cox.net.
