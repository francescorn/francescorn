I am Frances Cornwall.

I am a current contributor to Webkit's WebInspectorUI.

I proposed an All Fonts Feature at the Webkit Contributors Meeting 2023.

I graduated from Vassar College with a bachelor's degree in biology.

I decided to pursue software engineering after college from enjoying statistical software courses, the web developer experience, and coding.

I'm a former college tennis player who won the Matthew Vassar award.

I'm looking for a role as a software engineer.

My skills include HTML, CSS, Javascript, React, C++, and Python.

You can reach me at frances_c@cox.net.
