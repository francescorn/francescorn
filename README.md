Hi, I’m Frances Cornwall. I’m interested in frontend development and python.

I graduated from Vassar College with a bachelor's degree in biology.

I'm a former college tennis player who won the Matthew Vassar award.

I’m currently looking for a role as a software engineer.

My skills include HTML, CSS, Javascript, React, and Python.

You can reach me at fcornwall@alum.vassar.edu.
