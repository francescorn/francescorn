Hi, I’m Frances Cornwall. I’m interested in software engineering.

Currently a contributor to Webkit's WebInspectorUI

I graduated from Vassar College with a bachelor's degree in biology, and decided to pursue software engineering after college

I'm a former college tennis player who won the Matthew Vassar award.

I’m looking for a role as a software engineer.

My skills include HTML, CSS, Javascript, React, C++, and Python.
