I am Frances Cornwall.

I am a contributor to WebKit's WebInspectorUI.

I proposed an All Fonts Feature at the WebKit Contributors Meeting 2023.

I graduated from Vassar College with a bachelor's degree in biology.

I decided to pursue software engineering after college.

I'm a former college tennis player who won the Matthew Vassar award.

I'm looking for a role as a software engineer.

My skills include HTML, CSS, Javascript, React, C++, Regex, and Python.

You can reach me at frances_c@cox.net or fcornwall@alum.vassar.edu.

Do not send me any spam or phishing emails, I will write a report to the FBI and possibly more.
