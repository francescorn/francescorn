Hi, I’m Frances Cornwall. I’m interested in frontend development.

I graduated from Vassar College with a bachelor's degree in biology, and decided to pursue software engineering after college.

I'm a former college tennis player who won the Matthew Vassar award.

I’m currently looking for a role as a software engineer.

I am currently a contributing to Webkit's WebInspectorUI

My skills include HTML, CSS, Javascript, React, and Python.
